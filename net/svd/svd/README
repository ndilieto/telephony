README for SVD
=====================

What is it?
-----------

SVD is a simple sip client using the FXS ports on the infineon danube.
It uses sofia-sip to manage the sip part and a custom written library
(libab) to manage the ports.
You can define multiple sip accounts, decide which FXS ports to use for
outgoing calls and which ports to ring for incoming calls.

Placing a call
--------------
To place a call simply dial a number once you hear the dialtone.
The call will be placed after 4 seconds you keyed in the last digit or
after you dial # (the # won't be part of the dialled number).
To determine the account to use to place the call, first the dialplan
will be checked, and if no entry matches, the call will be placed on
the sip account with the lowest priority. See below for instructions
about the dialplan and the configuration of the accounts.

Configuration
-------------
This program uses uci for configuration, there's a web interface available
in the package luci-svd but you can also manually edit the 
/etc/config/svd file.

Various sections can be defined:

  * config main
     general parameters

  * config account name
     parameters for a sip account, you can define as many sections as
     accounts you want to use, each with a different name

  * config dialplan
     dialplan entries (see below), as many as you want

  * config channel number
     overrides defaults parameters for one channel (number can be 1 or 2).

  * config codec name
     overrides default codec parameter. Name must be one of:
        G722, PCMU, PCMA, G729, G729E, G723, iLBC, G726-16, G726-32, G726-40, telephone-event
     repeat this section for each codec you want to modify


options in config main
----------------------

   * option log_level n
     optional - changes the logging level between 0 (quiet) and 9 (verbose)
    
   * option rtp_port_first n
     mandatory - number of the first port to use for rtp

   * option rtp_port_last n
     mandatory - number of the last port to use for rtp

   * option sip_tos n
     mandatory -tos for sip traffic

   * option rtp_tos n
     mandatory - tos for rtp traffic

   * option led name
     optional - name of the led to use as the main voip led.
     If configured the led will turn on when there's at least one account successfully
     registered.

   * option local_ip
     optional - in case there are multiple network interfaces, sofia sip
     doesn't always select the correct one for outgoing messages. In that
     case you can specify the ip address of the interface to use. WARNING
     since this is a global setting, there is no way to use different
     interfaces for different accounts.

   example:

	config main
	    option log_level 5
	    option rtp_port_first 5500
	    option rtp_port_last 5600
	    option sip_tos 0x10
	    option rtp_tos 0x10
	    option led "soc:green:voip"

options in config account
-------------------------
 
  * option user "username"
    mandatory, username of the account

  * option domain "domain"
    mandatory, domain of the account

  * option password "password"
    mandatory, password of the account

  * option display "display_name"
    optional, sip display name. It will be used as is, if quotes are needed
    you'll have to write them yourself, e.g. '"display name"'

  * option registrar "registrar"
    optional, host name of the registrar, if not defined "domain" will be used

  * option auth_name "auth_name"
    optional, username for authentication, if not defined "user" will be used

  * option outbound_proxy "proxy"
    optional, proxy to be used for outgoing calls. If not defined no
    outbound proxy will be used.

  * option user_agent "user agent string"
    optional, user agent for this account. If not defined, the default
    ("svd VoIP agent") will be used.

  * option codecs "codec1 codec2 codec3 ..."
    optional, list of codecs to use ordered by priority. If not defined, all
    codecs will be used in this order:
    G722, PCMU, PCMA, G729, G729E, G723, iLBC, G726-16, G726-32, G726-40
   
  * option ring 'off on'
    optional, list of booleans. Decides which channel will ring for incoming
    calls to this account. If not defined, all channels will ring.

  * option priority '0 1'
    optional, list of integers (one integer for each channel).
    When a number is dialled on a channel, first the dialplan will be tried to
    decide the account to use. If no dialplan entry matches, the lowest priority
    correctly registered account will be used. An account with 0 priority will not be used.

  * option dtmf type
    optional, how to send dtmf on this account.
    type can be "rfc2883", "info" or "off".
    if not defined, "rfc2833" will be used.

  * option disabled on
    optional, use it to disable an account without removing it from the configuration.

  * option user_agent "My user agent"
    optional user agent to use instead of the default (some sip registrars
    only allow registration coming with a specific user agent, e.g. Jazztel
    in Spain).

  examples:
     
    minimal configuration

       config account test1
           option user "testuser"
           option domain "sip.test.domain"
           option password "testpassword"
      
    this account will ring every channel and it will be used by every channel
    for outgoing calls.

    more complete configuration

       config account test2
           option user "testuser2"
           option domain "sip2.test.domain"
           option auth_name "authuser"
           option display '"my display name"'
           option registrar "proxy.test.domain"
           option password "testpassword"
           option outbound_proxy "outproxy.test.domain"
           option codecs "g729 pcma"
           option ring 'off on'
           option priority '0 7'
           option dtmf info

    this account will only ring the second channel and it will only be used
    for outgoing calls by the second channel, provided there's no other channel
    with a priority lower than 7.

         
options in config dialplan
--------------------------

  * option prefix "1234"
    mandatory, prefix of the dialled number that matches this entry

  * option replace "abcd"
    optional, the matched prefix will be replaced by this string

      option account "test2"

   when a number starting with 00 is dialled, account "test1" will be used
    (e.g. 001234  will call 001234@sip.test.domain)
   when a number starting with 777 is dialled, account "test2" will be used,
